# lac-entertainment-landing

For this project, I am tasked with creating a landing page for a business. I have actually been asked by my mother to create a website for her LLC and figure it's worthwhile to meld that project into this one as a jumping off point. I may not use the exact structure of the example site, but am planning to include all of the elements in one way or another, so as to satisfy the overall learning goals of the project. 

Site will include:
- Header - logo on left and navigation buttons on right with flexed space between
- Multiple containers of information 
    - A quote - I would like there to be multiple quotes that are turned into a cycling banner of testimonials 
    - A call to action banner w button - Will likely be a contact element
    - 3-4 photos with text center-aligned beneath
    - Elements with rounded corner borders

I will be using my own ideas surrounding aesthetics, based off the branding conversations my mother and I have previously had. 

Color scheme: Navy, dark purple, black, gold, white
Concept: celestial, minimal, classic, feminine, mystical

    Bones of landing page are complete. After rereading my original notes, I'm happy that I've achieved what I set out to.
